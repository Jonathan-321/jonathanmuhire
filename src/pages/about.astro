        <h1 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-8">About Me</h1>
        
        <p>
          I'm Jonathan Muhire, a software R&D and ML researcher focused on deep learning systems, multimodal research,
          and scalable data infrastructure. I previously co-founded Neotix, where we built data pipelines and tooling
          for large-scale machine learning.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Background</h2>
        <p>
          I hold a dual degree in Computer Science (BS) and Artificial Intelligence (MS), which has given me a strong 
          foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of building intelligent systems. My work sits at the 
          intersection of ML research, deep learning, and distributed systems.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Current Focus</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently exploring multimodal modeling techniques for robust ML systems, with a particular interest in:

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Multimodal representation learning</li>
          <li>Data-centric AI and synthetic augmentation</li>
          <li>Scalable data infrastructure and dataset versioning</li>
          <li>Efficient training and evaluation pipelines</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Projects & Experience</h2>
        <p>
          My recent work includes building data extraction pipelines, creating version-controlled infrastructure for 
          large-scale datasets, and developing tools to support ML experimentation and evaluation. I've shipped systems 
          across research prototypes and production-grade pipelines.
