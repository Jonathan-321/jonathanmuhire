        <h1 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-8">About Me</h1>
        
        <p>
          I'm Jonathan Muhire, previously co-founder at Neotix where we built infrastructure for robotics data collection 
          and embodied AI systems. I'm passionate about creating the foundation that enables robots to understand and 
          interact with our physical world through continuous learning.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Background</h2>
        <p>
          I hold a dual degree in Computer Science (BS) and Artificial Intelligence (MS), which has given me a strong 
          foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of building intelligent systems. My work sits at the 
          intersection of robotics, machine learning, and distributed systems.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Current Focus</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently exploring multimodal fusion techniques for robust embodied AI, with a particular interest in:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Curriculum learning for robotic manipulation</li>
          <li>Synthetic data augmentation for sim-to-real transfer</li>
          <li>Scalable data infrastructure for robotics</li>
          <li>Real-time teleoperation and imitation learning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Projects & Experience</h2>
        <p>
          My recent work includes developing teleoperation systems for bimanual manipulation, building data extraction 
          pipelines for visual SLAM, and creating version-controlled infrastructure for large-scale robotics datasets. 
          I've worked with various robotic platforms including MyCobot, UMI, and LeRobot.
